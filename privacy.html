		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>
			This document serves as the Privacy Policy for all services operated by FloatingMilkshake ("I", "me", "my"). Last
			updated on <code>2025-08-15</code> (history is public, see
			<a href="https://github.com/FloatingMilkshake/floatingmilkshake.com/commits/main/privacy.html">here</a>!).
			You can reach out with any questions or concerns at <a>privacy [at] floatingmilkshake [dot] com</a>.

			<br><br>
			As of the last time this document was updated, no services operated by me intentionally collect any identifying user data. The
			following services operated by me <i>do</i> collect some non-identifying user data:

		</p>

		<div id="MechanicalMilkshake">
			<h3>MechanicalMilkshake</h3>
			<p>
				MechanicalMilkshake processes some data provided by Discord, but does not store this data. This data may consist of:
				<ul>
					<li>The content of any message sent in any Discord channel where MechanicalMilkshake has permission to read
						messages (including future updates to the message's content)
					</li>
					<li>Certain data about the author of any message sent in any Discord channel where MechanicalMilkshake has
						permission to read messages, such as their user ID, username, or display name
					</li>
					<li>Certain data about you if you or another user use a command that fetches data about you or your profile, such as your
						user ID, display name, avatar, when you created your Discord account, any roles you may have in a server, and any badges you may
						have on your Discord profile
					</li>
				</ul>
				MechanicalMilkshake offers features such as keyword tracking that require it to process all messages sent in any
				channels it is able to read messages in. It does this so that it can notify a user if a keyword they have chosen to
				track is mentioned. MechanicalMilkshake keeps a temporary cache of message IDs, their respective authors' user IDs,
				and the IDs of the channels in which the messages whose IDs are cached were sent, to reduce the number of requests made to Discord.
				MechanicalMilkshake only keeps this data in memory for the most recent message sent in any Discord channel. This information is never stored persistently, and you may
				request to have your data deleted from this cache or opt out of it at any time by emailing me at the address
				at the top of this page. If you are a server administrator, you may also deny MechanicalMilkshake permission to read
				messages in any channel whose messages you do not want processed. You can always review the source code of MechanicalMilkshake to confirm
				this behavior <a href="https://github.com/FloatingMilkshake/MechanicalMilkshake">here</a>.
				<br><br>
				MechanicalMilkshake collects some data that is stored persistently, however only under certain circumstances. This
				data may consist of:
				<ul>
					<li>Your Discord user ID</li>
					<li>Some user-submitted content</li>
				</ul>
				MechanicalMilkshake offers features such as reminders that require it to store some information, such as your
				Discord user ID and the content of any reminders you set, persistently. This information is deleted as soon as
				possible - in the case of reminders, it is deleted when the reminder is triggered at the time you specify.
				
				<br><br>
				All data collected by MechanicalMilkshake is stored in Ashburn, Virginia, United States by <a href="https://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>.
				All data stored by MechanicalMilkshake can be requested or deleted at any time, however this data may still persist
				in temporary backups stored for a limited amount of time.

			<h3>Hastebin</h3>
			<p>
				Hastebin (accessible at <a href="https://haste.floatingmilkshake.com">haste.floatingmilkshake.com</a>) allows
				users to input any text data and use a URL generated by the service to share this data. Data submitted to
				Hastebin (by entering text and pressing Save) is stored indefinitely. Data may be removed earlier for any reason
				and without notice, but for privacy purposes it should be assumed that any data submitted to Hastebin will be stored indefinitely.
				
				<br><br>
				Data submitted to Hastebin is stored by <a href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> in
				<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/workers-kv/">Cloudflare Workers KV</a>.
				<i>This data is not encrypted prior to storing in Workers KV. By submitting data to Hastebin, you understand that
				it can be read by me.</i> If you don't like that, encrypt your data first.
				
				<br><br>
				All data submitted to Hastebin can be requested or deleted at any time (as long as the URL is provided) and is
				not stored in any backups or by anyone other than Cloudflare. Once the data is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
