        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            This document serves as the Privacy Policy for all services operated by FloatingMilkshake ("I", "me", "my"). Last updated on <code>2022-07-26 23:23 -0400</code>.
            <br><br>
            As of the last time this document was updated, no services operated by me collect any identifying user data. The following services operated by me <i>do</i> collect some non-identifying user data.

                MechanicalMilkshake processes some data provided by Discord, but does not store this data. This data may consist of:
                <ul>
                    <li>The content of any message sent in any Discord channel where MechanicalMilkshake has permission to read messages (including future updates to the message's content)</li>
                    <li>Certain data about the author of any message sent in any Discord channel where MechanicalMilkshake has permission to read messages, such as their User ID and name</li>
                    <li>Certain data about you if a user uses a command that fetches data about you/your profile, such as your name, avatar, when you created your Discord account, any roles you may have in a server, and any badges you may have on your Discord profile</li>
                </ul>
                MechanicalMilkshake offers features such as keyword tracking that require it to process all messages sent in any channels it is able to read messages in. It does this so that it can notify a user if a keyword they have chosen to track is mentioned. No data about messages, such as their content or author, is stored persistently.
                <br><br>
                MechanicalMilkshake collects some data that is stored persistently, however only under certain circumstances. This data may consist of:

                    <li>Your Discord User ID</li>
                    <li>Some user-submitted content</li>
                </ul>
                MechanicalMilkshake offers features such as reminders that require it to store some information, such as your Discord User ID and the content of any reminders you set, persistently. This information is deleted as soon as possible - in the case of reminders, it is deleted when the reminder is triggered at the time you specify.
