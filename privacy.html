<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
	This document serves as the Privacy Policy for all services operated by FloatingMilkshake ("I", "me", "my"). Last
	updated on <code>2022-11-29</code> (history is public, see <a href="https://github.com/FloatingMilkshake/floatingmilkshake.com/search?q=privacy&type=commits">here</a>!). You can reach out with any questions or concerns at
	<span style="color: #4c9eff"><b>privacy [at] floatingmilkshake [dot] com</b></span>.

	<br><br>
	As of the last time this document was updated, no services operated by me collect any identifying user data. The
	following services operated by me <i>do</i> collect some non-identifying user data.

<div id="MechanicalMilkshake">
	<h3>MechanicalMilkshake</h3>
	<p>
		MechanicalMilkshake processes some data provided by Discord, but does not store this data. This data may consist
		of:
		<ul>
			<li>The content of any message sent in any Discord channel where MechanicalMilkshake has permission to read
				messages (including future updates to the message's content)
			</li>
			<li>Certain data about the author of any message sent in any Discord channel where MechanicalMilkshake has
				permission to read messages, such as their User ID and name
			</li>
			<li>Certain data about you if a user uses a command that fetches data about you/your profile, such as your name,
				avatar, when you created your Discord account, any roles you may have in a server, and any badges you may
				have on your Discord profile
			</li>
		</ul>
		MechanicalMilkshake offers features such as keyword tracking that require it to process all messages sent in any
		channels it is able to read messages in. It does this so that it can notify a user if a keyword they have chosen to
		track is mentioned. No data about messages, such as their content or author, is stored persistently.
		<br><br>
		MechanicalMilkshake collects some data that is stored persistently, however only under certain circumstances. This
		data may consist of:
		<ul>
			<li>Your Discord User ID</li>
			<li>Some user-submitted content</li>
		</ul>
		MechanicalMilkshake offers features such as reminders that require it to store some information, such as your
		Discord User ID and the content of any reminders you set, persistently. This information is deleted as soon as
		possible - in the case of reminders, it is deleted when the reminder is triggered at the time you specify.
		
		<br><br>
		Data stored by MechanicalMilkshake is stored in Ashburn, Virginia, United States by <a
			href="https://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>. <i>By using MechanicalMilkshake, you agree to <a
			href="https://www.oracle.com/legal/privacy/privacy-policy.html">Oracle's privacy policy</a></i>.
		<br>All data stored by MechanicalMilkshake can be requested or deleted at any time - however, this data may persist in weekly backups taken by Oracle for up to five (5) weeks.
		Backups are taken on Sunday at 00:00 UTC every week. Individual data cannot be deleted from backups, but backups expire five (5) weeks after creation.

		<br><br>
		Entire backups can be deleted on request in some circumstances.
		Please contact me at the email at the top of this page if you would like to request that your data be deleted from MechanicalMilkshake or backups, or to request a copy of your data.

		<br><br>
		No data stored by any services operated by FloatingMilkshake is shared with any third-parties other than those listed here, and data is only shared when absolutely necessary for the function of the services.
